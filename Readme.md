# Title
Training Neural Networks using Backpropagation

# Description
Neural networks, which form the bedrock of deep learning, are trained using the backpropagation algorithm. The algorithm finds the optimal weights and biases for the various neurons forming the network to best approximate the relationship between the predictor and target variables.

The goal of this project is to implement the following without using only low-level libraries:
1. A logistic regression model using gradient descent
2. A shallow neural network using backpropagation
3. A deep neural network using backpropagation

# Contents
The code files include 3 Jupyter notebooks, one for each model.

# Results
Similar values of the logistic regression parameters in sections 2 & 3 of 'Logistic Regression Gradient Descent.ipynb' indicate that the custom gradient descent implementation is correct.
